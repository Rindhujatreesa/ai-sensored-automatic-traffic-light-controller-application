# Automatic Traffic Light Controller Application with AI Image Sensoring

## Project Proposal
An application that controls traffic signals based on the traffic from each direction, i.e., if the traffic from a direction is zero - no vehicles, then the traffic light will be green for the other directions unless a vehicle comes in the former path or a pedestrian pressed to cross the road. The input for the application will be the data collected by cameras or sensors on the road with True as when there is a vehicle and False as when there is no vehicle.
